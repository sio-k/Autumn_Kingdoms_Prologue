Originally created by Devrailis Colandore.

Campaign Description
----

All kingdoms fall. Join Captain Aldehar as he witnesses the rise of a revolution, and the changing of an era. Incomplete: 12 scenarios of 17. Version 0.1.10.

Ported to Wesnoth version 1.14; original creator unreachable since 2009. All contributions and fixes are welcome.

CAUTION: Still a lot of bugs, a lot of which probably undiscovered. Saving/loading should at least work properly now, though.

Installing
-----

Put in your `userdata/add-ons/` folder (either inside the Wesnoth folder, in `/home/username/.local/share/wesnoth`, `/home/username/.config/wesnoth-1.14/`, or `C:/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/Wesnoth`).
