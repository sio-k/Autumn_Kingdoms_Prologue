* saves are broken with Advance Wesnoth Wars:
** newly encountered units in scenario 3 - Amidst the Laansratch aren't saved at all unless they're used to attack
** AWW doesn't impact those units
** AWW has significant issues affecting most units until they have been in combat with a unit that AWW already governs
** TODO figure out if saves are broken without AWW, too. Might be we're using *really* old unit spawning syntax.
* TODO unit cfgs use some old syntax; needs changing
* TODO unit cfgs are missing complete race/faction definitions
* DONE Aramelle Eluviss at lvl1 has a wrongly offset health bar and unit icon
CLOSED: [2021-03-14 Sun 14:58]
* DONE there are some bugs specific to hard mode
CLOSED: [2021-03-14 Sun 14:44]
* TODO macro redefinitions without explicit #undef in utils.cfg
* TODO All leadership trees use leadership one level higher than the unit level. If memory serves, this is now termed "inspire". If it works differently: create a different leadership-type trait for our units to represent this.
* TODO insane savegame bugs - specific to scenario 3
** TODO enemy units are never saved nor loaded properly; randomly they are loaded/saved properly
** TODO friendly units don't have their current move points, levels, or... well, anything really saved or restored properly
*** TODO figure out whether this is because of the way Perrin's patrol squad is handled
*** TODO figure out how these types of things are handled in other campaigns
** TODO something about how units get spawned is fucky and only barely works
*** TODO figure out where the hack is; this is probably a hack to make the entire thing work in v1.4
*** TODO figure out what the correct way to do this stuff is now
** issue is:
Multiple units have the same id. Only one unit can have a certain id in v1.14 (multiple units with the same id were apparently permitted in v1.4/v1.6 somehow before) - BUT ONLY FOR SAVEGAME PURPOSES.
** TODO fix: go through all scenarios and make sure all units have different ids
