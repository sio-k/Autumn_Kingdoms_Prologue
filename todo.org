* TODO bugs
* TODO speaker portraits of some kind at least, even if inaccurate
* TODO nicer scenario objectives
* TODO scenario objectives that update
* TODO attack sounds
* TODO hit sounds
* TODO improve the unit sprites so they look a little less awkward (crossbowmen in particular aren't great)
* TODO replace all WML code with Lua code instead, keeping only the declarative bits in WML (WML-as-a-programming-language looks like a mess, is rather unreadable, and causes us to bury stuff in macros within macros, which is a bit of a problem for maintaining all of this long term)
